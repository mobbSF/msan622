### Dataset:  

The dataset is from [SimplyHired.com]('http://www.SimplyHired.com").  It consists of a sample of 2,083 jobs that have the term “data science” in the job description.  The data are stale (from 2013) and are for demonstration purposes only.  The dataset consists of fields holding information about company, location, salary, industry, and job description.

The visualization allows the user to specify a salary range and a state, and returns a visual representation of the location and quantity of jobs openings.
